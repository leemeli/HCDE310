f = open("sherlock.txt",'r')
fstring = f.read()    #assign fstring long string with the whole file


# This is a function that will replace (most) punctuation
# you'll see it again in the homework
def stripWordPunctuation(word):
    return word.strip(".,()<>\"\\'~?!-;*/")

wordlist = fstring.split()

### Challenge 0: count the number of times the words
### elementary and obviously appear in Sherlock Holmes
### note that we have already opened, read, and split the
### file for you above
