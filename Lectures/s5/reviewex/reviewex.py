### variable assignments
# 1: add statements immediately below so that print x*y prints out 12
# (before you do this, it will result in an error)

print x*y

### expressions
# 2: determine what the following will print (after you have done #1)

print 3 + x * y
print (3 + x) * y

### 3 string operations
s = "Hello World \n"
# write code that does the following, 

# 3a: print s in all upper case

# 3b: print s in all lower case

# 3c: print s without an extra blank line

# 3d: use slicing to extract and print "World"

# 3e: write a line of code so that print subst will
#     print "Hello" (until you write this, it will produce an error)

print subst

# 3f: write code that counts how many words are in s

# 3g: write code to find out how many non-whitespace characters are
#     in s (i.e, the characters that are not "\t", "\n", or " ")
