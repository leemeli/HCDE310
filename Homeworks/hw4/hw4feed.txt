post: Hello! I am working on part 8 of the FeedProcessor assignment. I keep getting this error and do not quite understand how the test lines of code work with the code I have written. In particular, I am confused how the word ["anyone"] gets linked with the function without parameters in the function.
from: Sean Munson
comment: Hi Mallory - in this line of code, the return value of wordFreq("hw3feed.txt",'post') gets substituted in. Your function, if working properly, will return a dictionary (and from this error, it looks like it is).  wordFreq("hw3feed.txt",'post')["anyone"] then refers to the value corresponding to "anyone" in that dictionary. The line compares that value with 9 to see if it matches. There is also a second comparison, for eclipse and 5.  From the error, it looks like the returned dictionary does not contain the key "anyone."  If I were debugging, the first place I'd start is to call wordFreq("hw3feed.txt","post") and print the return value to see if it looks like what I expect, i.e., add a line before the test lines: print wordFreq("hw3feed.txt","post")
from: Pooja Ghelani
comment: I get the same error, I did what you suggested and called the function to print the return value. All I get is an empty dictionary
from: Sean Munson
comment: In that case, my next step would be to add some print statements in my for loop to make sure it is actually iterating through the file.   If it isn't, the next thing I would check is whether I'm re-opening the file *within* the function (recall that each time we read the file, it "consumes" it, so we have to re-open it)  If it is, then I'd look at the dictionary as I am building it (inside the for loop). Is it adding things? If not, can I figure out why?
from: Pooja Ghelani
post: I keep getting this error when I run part 8. Would anyone be able to tell me what it means?
from: Sean Munson
comment: Hi Pooja -- I think this is referring to the variable "file" -- which corresponds to <type 'file'> in Python. Double check your variable and a parameter names for the file name / file handle in wordFreq()

comment: Hi Sheena - for getting the Lectures and Original Homework folders back, see #1 on this page: https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1066100/pages/eclipse-troubleshooting (skipping the part about Homeworks, since it looks like that is still there)  I'm not totally sure about Git. From the icons in the screenshot on the left, it looks like they are committed and up to date, in which case the message in terminal would be correct. If you look at your repository on the web, does it show the hw3 files?

comment: It doesn't seem to push to my repository using terminal, although it seemed easier to use terminal in the beginning, I did try commit/push in eclipse (Git Staging; Team > Commit...) and it worked using that, so I think I'll keep doing it that way for now!
from: Alex Gilbert
comment: if you still want to push using terminal, it looks like you're not adding every file to be commited, but it expects those files as well. once you navigate to the terminal, you can type "git add ." to add -everything- before git commit and git push

post: So for some reason I have no access to Virtual Box anymore. I don't know how to go about fixing this. Can anyone help?
from: Anushree Shukla
comment: try restarting Linux?
from: Sean Munson
comment: Hi - have you moved any of the files? VirtualBox is somewhat brittle with how it handles moving any of the files.
from: John Porter
comment: Some students have been able to fix this issue by removing the virtual machine from the VirtualBox manager (right click on it in the list, and then 'remove') and then adding it again by double-clicking on the vbox file in your Mint directory. All of your work is contained in the vdi file, so as long as you still have that, you should be able to re-add the machine and have it pick up right where you left off. Just make sure it doesn't delete when you remove the machine, if it asks!

post: I've been getting this error, while running hw3feedprocessor.py the problem I'm having is specifically in part 8. I was wondering if someone could tell me what this error means
from: Alex Gilbert
comment: hey! the error itself means that you're trying to "get" some data (just as array[0] would "get" the 1st element of the array), but the reason it's not getting anything is because your object basically doesn't exist/have any data to pull from. in this case the if statement is trying to get ['anyone'] from your wordFreq(fname, 'post) - that means your wordFreq isn't a proper dictionary.  one possible solution is that you're not returning anything! if you don't return a dictionary, there is no dictionary object to get data from. if you are returning something, i would go back and check out how you set up your dictionary. hope this helps!

post: I'm not sure what happened because I was able to commit/push earlier into my respository, but now it's not working. I was working on hw2 Part 2 and I'm getting errors when I try to commit. I deleted the hw2 files and added them again, and then had to change the hw2-exercises.py file to hw2exercises.py because it said it was invalid. Here's what happens in terminal: I appreciate any help!
from: Sean Munson
comment: Hi Sheena - to help debug, did you add hw2/* to git before or after changing file names and deleting them?
from: Sheena White
comment: I did it before and after I changed the names... when I exited out of everything after deleting all hw2 files, then started VirtualBox again, I went to add hw2 files using "./gethW.sh 2" and when I open hw2-execises.py it says "Invalid name for Python module: hw2-exercises (it'll not be analyzed)"
from: Sheena White
comment: this time I didn't change the name, didn't work on the hw2-exercises.py file and just tried to commit but it gives me the same message
from: Sean Munson
comment: My guess is that git got confused by losing track of the deleted files.   If you haven't finished hw2, it's probably best to work through that first, since you can finish that and upload a copy to Canvas without git working.  For troubleshooting, the first thing I'd try is to try a commit that notices removed files: git commit -a -m "hw2: Part 2 complete"
from: Sean Munson
comment: That may still, though, give you an error, in which case it may be easier to debug in office hours or class.
from: Sheena White
comment: Ok, I've already finished with the hw2-exercises.py so I'll try and figure that out... but I'm stuck now on part3: I keep getting 18 characters for test.txt instead of 22 like it says, but I still count 18 characters??
from: Sheena White
comment: with using end of line characters, I still only get 20, am I missing something?  This is splitting only whitespace: ['This\n'] ['is', 'our\n'] ['test', 'file.'] 20 characters
from: Sean Munson
comment: Spaces are also characters - remember that split() removes the white space it splits on.

Could anyone please explain why I'm getting this error message? Why does it say "no module named hw1. hw1" on the console? This was not showing up before I started number 4. Thanks!
from: Jessie Kuo
comment: I had that same problem last Thursday and professor Sean told me that happens to eclipse sometimes. All you have to do is comment it out with "#"
from: Michael Fern
comment: Jessie Kuo has the gist of it,  This is happening because eclipse is auto completing the import statement "from h1.hw1 import lst", this happens when you press tab or sometimes even automatically fills in itself. This line will is not necessary for the assignment and can be deleted completely, although commenting would work too

comment: is there a good way to make sure the .py files I am submitting is the committed and changed version of the homework?
from: Sean Munson
comment: I'm not sure what shows up in the view you get on Canvas, but at least in our grading view, Canvas shows the python file as plain text.  The most common mistake in past years has been uploading from Homeworks_OriginalVersion, so double check that (a) you've saved the Python file in Eclipse or your other editor and (b) that you're uploading from the right folder.  Also, if you continue committing and pushing to Bitbucket (please do!), you can check on the web that you've successfully sent your code to the repository. On the web, you can go to your repository, git, source, and then the homework file. This also gives you a timestamped backup, just in case anything goes wrong with the Canvas submission.

comment: thanks. This looks like progress. Let's try:  cd ~/CourseFiles/hcde310a16/ git pull origin master  if that works, then we can change back to the home directory and try to get HW2  cd ~ ./getHW.sh 2
from: Eric Eckert
post: Hello,  The getHW.sh has a small issues that I would like to highlight. After some testing I discovered that if the files/folders in ./CourseFiles/hcde310a16/Homeworks are altered or moved, and getHW.sh is run again, the git fetch only seems to check whether the correct subdirectories exist and not the files. And if getHW.sh is run with a number parameter, it's written to simply copy the .py files from ./CourseFiles/hcde310a16/Homeworks to ./Homeworks. The result is that when the latter is called, the former files do not exist and the homework cannot be fetched. But if getHw.sh is called again, it does not replace the .py files because the subdirectories do exist.  I tried a few different options and discovered that git fetch followed by git reset --hard solves the problem on my computer because it always overrides everything in ./CourseFiles/hcde310a16. That shouldn't be a problem because the user is asked if they want to override the Homework files when copying them over anyways. The git reset --hard seems to not work on the Linux mint vm. Maybe one of the TAs can do some testing with this?
from: Sean Munson
comment: Thanks Eric. I've looked through, and a couple of notes:  =Virtual Machine = This seems to be working as expected. The git pull is outside the conditional and will run regardless of whether an argument is provided.  It does have the issue that if you delete a hw directory within CourseFiles/Homeworks, it won't reappear -- this is git performing as expected. This should be okay since the CourseFiles directory is meant to mostly be left alone with homeworks instead being done in ~/Homeworks.   I was able to run git reset --hard within the hcde310a16 directory (note: not encouraging this in general, since it'll overwrite any changes you have made to lecture files).  = getHW.sh on Canvas (for macOS) =  I've looked here too -- the git pull is outside the the conditionals, so the git fetch should be running regardless of whether it is run with our without the number.  So it seems like the only issue that occurs is when files or directories are moved from within ./CourseFIles/hcde310a16/Homeworks?  It's also possible I'm misunderstanding, so please let me know if so.
from: Eric Eckert
comment: Sean  Thanks for the quick reply! I do think we're on the same page. I didn't know that its not supposed to replace the files so I suppose nothing is wrong there. Yes in theory there shouldn't be any missing homework directories but I've encountered some cases where some of them are in fact missing, and the student was not able to pull homeworks as a result. I am just wondering if that base could be covered in case it happens again.
from: Sean Munson
comment: Got it, thanks - I'll give it some thought and test some things; also adding Michael to the thread to think about it. I've tried to pick the right set of tradeoffs between which mistakes are possible vs. prevented with this script, but knowing which issues come up can help us rethink it.
from: Eric Eckert
comment: Thank you Sean!
from: Michael Fern
comment: My two cents, The way things are done can leave some confusion. With that said I have noticed that for some the distinction between the class repository that getHW pulls from(CourseFiles/hcde310a16) and the copy folders(i.e. Homeworks, Homeworks_OrginalVersions) allows for an initial understanding of a couple of the more core 'Git rules'. Ideally, if the system is used correctly people shouldn't have to do too much else other than running 'getHW.*' To do that however, sometimes some further explanation of Git is necessary.  Eric it seems like you are adding a bit of customization to your system, which is great! If you want to stop by office hours to show us what you've done we would be happy to take a look and perhaps change the class copy of 'getHW.*' script to make the system as a whole more intuitive. If this interests you I have intended office hours are from 12-1pm and alternatively have free time before and after that :-)
from: Becky Baron
post: I'm using my own environment and eclipse insisted that I change the names of my files to use an underscore instead of a dash because otherwise the name was not "a valid identifier." For example, I'm now using the file name  "hw2_exercises.py" instead of "hw2-exercises.py". I'm not really sure what the issue is, but will it be a problem if i submit the files on canvas with the different names?
from: Sean Munson
comment: Hi Becky -- that should be okay. If it's easy to rename them when you upload, that might save the TAs a few seconds but overall not a major issue. (but John or Chia-Fang, please speak up if this will break your grading process!)
from: Michael Fern
post: Hi everyone working on wishing their on environments!  We made a small bug fix to 'getHW.*' (both .sh and the .bat files). Both files have been re uploaded to canvas with the fix. The feature we added allows the macOS and Windows versions of 'getHW.*' to mirror the process that is used in mint. It's not necessary to change to this file so if you are happy with your current setup, please keep using it.  New "getHW.*" file: https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1066100/files/folder/getHW.*  'getHW.*' directions for Windows and macOS https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1066100/pages/git-on-windows-and-mac-with-gethw-dot-star
from: Eric Eckert
comment: Thanks for the new script! I took a look at it and noticed it creates a "Homework" and "Homework Original Version" directory, but it pulls to "/CourseFiles/hcde310a16/Homeworks" leaving the former two directories empty. Were we supposed to use those directories for something?
from: Michael Fern
comment: Correct, if you run just the getHW.sh script those two folders will be created but left empty. To update 'Homeworks' and Homeworks_OringinalVersions' you have to designate which hw set to download. So.. $ sh getHW.sh 2 will  copy the files for the HW2 folder only

post: [HW2 & beyond] If you would like to submit a newer version of any part of the assignment, please resubmit all the files.  Canvas only allows us batch-download the latest submission.

from: Sean Munson
comment: Hi Lauren. Thanks for asking -- on this one: 1) we'd prefer that you make the repo private.  2) Canvas makes it really easy for us to download all the assignments at once, which gets a bit harder when code is distributed across 90 repositories. It would help the TAs give everyone timely feedback if you can upload the file.

from: Sean Munson
comment: Hi Kelly -- for some reason, the latest version of Eclipse doesn't seem to always recognize that you've changed a file and that it should be staged.   After you click "commit", you'll see a dialog box / panel for your commit. To the left, there should be a box "unstaged files" -- right click on the file you've changed and click "add to index"  This should work. It's also annoying, and so it may be easier to commit from terminal. I'll post notes on that shortly.

from: Sean Munson
comment: Hi Kelly -- it's usually "cd <directory name>".  e.g., "cd Homeworks" will move you from your home folder to the Homeworks folder. One common, easy error here is that directory names are case sensitive.   If that doesn't do the trick, let us know which folder, and/or post a screenshot and I or others may have more ideas!

comment: A couple of students had this issue in class on Thursday -- the issue seemed to be having two copies of VirtualBox open at the same time (which can be hard to see in Windows, because of how it aggregates different instances in the task bar).

from: Alex Gilbert
comment: hey all, I've done some testing and found a solution for you. it is a bit of a hassle, so if needed I can look at it in class. for those who want to try it now (I've only tested on windows!), here it is:  1) Open up your command prompt (by typing cmd in the start menu and clicking on it). Navigate to where you installed virtual box - if you didn't move it around, you can type  cd C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox\  into your cmd.  2) Now, you'll have to copy and paste   VBOXMANAGE.EXE internalcommands sethduuid "DIRECTORY"  into your cmd, except replace DIRECTORY with the HCDE310 .vdi file location. Make sure you keep the quotes! for example, my file is located at C:\Users\Alex\Downloads\mint2\HCDE310-linuxmint-17.1-cinnamon-64bit.vdi, so I would type   VBOXMANAGE.EXE internalcommands sethduuid "C:\Users\Alex\Downloads\mint2\HCDE310-linuxmint-17.1-cinnamon-64bit.vdi"  This changes the UUID - you're getting this error because you've moved the location of the VM and are using the same image. virtual box is funny that way.  This is slightly complex, so feel free to ask for clarification! Otherwise, I can help you in/after class tomorrow.

post: On the assignment description there are two different due dates and times listed, there's Monday at 8pm, and then there's the part that says the assignment needs to be completed by the start of the second lecture. I only saw the line that said it was due on Tuesday, so will I be counted as late if I just submitted now?
from: Sean Munson
comment: We don't count anything late for HW0; we just want to know who is still having tech issues so we can help before/during class on Tuesday.   For tomorrow, I won't promise to have reviewed any answers or surveys submitted after tonight, though!

post: What is the user name and password for git assemblia?
from: Sean Munson
comment: Hi Bonnie -- what's triggering this dialog box? There shoudn't be anything in the homework that requires authenticating with Assembla (it's set to read only public access).
from: Josephine Le
comment: I thought it was just the link to use when you "git clone <git repository URL>". I didn't use VM so this is the route I took to clone the hcde310a16 repository. You don't need user/pw when cloning
from: Sean Munson
comment: Ah, okay. This seems to want to open it in the web browser, which Assembla doesn't like. You can view the repository directly in a web browser with out being logged in at: https://app.assembla.com/spaces/hcde310a16/git/source  and the scripts *should* work fine if you run the getHW.* scripts (whichever is appropriate for your environment). It's just clicking the .git link that seems to ask for authentication.
from: Eric Eckert
comment: You actually don't need the username and pass in order to pull from the repository. You wont be able to access it on the browser but pulling it should be fine.

post: For part 8, are we assuming that the user will use an IDE to follow the instructions on how to count the number of words in a text file?
from: Sean Munson
comment: You can decide on what assumptions to make - these might be helpful to note in part 8 or to reflect on in part 9.

post: Is anyone else having an issue where everything in the Virtual Machine is showing up extremely small? I can barely read even the largest text on the screen and I'm not sure how to fix it. Here's a screenshot where I have it maximized:
from: Sean Munson
comment: Hi Becky - I *think* that what's happening is the virtual machine doesn't recognize it should be scaling up the display content for your high res display. I've fixed this in the past by going to the Mint menu (the one you have open in the screenshot), then "Preferences" -> "General" and setting "User Interface scaling" to "Double (Hi-DPI)"
from: Becky Baron
comment: That fixed it! Thank you!
from: Addison Simon
post: Once I have my screenshots saved within the Pictures folder of the virtual machine, is there a way I can export them so I can include them in word documents or PDFs for submitting the assignment to canvas?
from: Sean Munson
comment: On most systems, you can drag the files to the desktop on your main computer. You might have to enable this under the "Devices" menu -> Drag and Drop -> Guest to Host (or bidirectional)
from: Addison Simon
comment: I did that, and now it seems to allow the picture to be dragged and dropped onto my desktop, except within virtual machine I get a "dropping data..." notification that remains at 0% so the picture is never fully copied onto the desktop.
from: Sean Munson
comment: Hrm. This may mean it doesn't work so well on your system. Are you on Windows or macOS?   I'm on macOS, and sometimes for expedience I just take the screenshot using macOS's utilities (cmd+shift+4, and then drag around the area I want -- the trick is I have to be *outside* the virtual box to take a screenshot).
from: Madison Holbrook
comment: I used my main desktop to take snap shots of my screen, put them into a word document, wrote the rest of the assignment, and then emailed myself the PDF. I then opened my email and downloaded my PDF inside the virtual machine.
from: Addison Simon
comment: Okay. I'm on Windows, so I will try taking the photos not through the virtual machine. Thank you for the help!

post: Hello, did anyone get this error when trying to open the 64bit file?
from: Melody Lee
comment: I think I got this error when I tried to move the file somewhere else. I solved it by moving it back into downloads
from: Tien Do
comment: Hmm, I didn't move the file anywhere :/
from: Sean Munson
comment: Hi Tien - have you installed the extension pack? https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
from: Tien Do
comment: Yes, I have. I am going to try something and get back to you guys!
from: Tien Do
comment: I reinstalled everything and the error went away.

post: I'm a tad bit confused for part 7 of the homework. I can't seem to find where the 'project listing' tab would be off to the left of the screen that has the code file. I believe I downloaded it correctly though.
from: Kelsey Fukuda
comment: I think in eclipse in the lectures drop down you can look for s2. Or in the folders/files you can go to course files and then look through lectures
from: Sean Munson
comment: Kelsey's post covers where it should show up, and it does look like it downloaded fine.  The last time you tried it, it looks like the VM had some trouble connecting to the git repository. I'm actually having a similar problem now, so I'll keep an eye on it.
from: Celina Hipolito
post: Hey guys, I'm having trouble with the Virtual Machine. I've installed it fine but says "error: file '/boot/grub/i386-pc/normal.mod' not found" then the prompt "grub rescue>". I'm assuming I need to find this normal.mod file. Anyone know how to find it?
from: Sean Munson
comment: Hi Celina -- a couple of questions to help troubleshoot. (1) Did you install from the download or a USB drive? (2) did it ever run correctly on your machine?
from: Celina Hipolito
comment: I downloaded from google drive and no, it gives me this error every time.
from: Sean Munson
comment: If, in the VirtualBox Manager window, you click on settings, can you post a screenshot of the results?
from: Celina Hipolito
comment: 
from: Celina Hipolito
comment: Also possibly of interest, it gives a warning upon starting the VM manager:
from: Sean Munson
comment: thanks -- can you try running "check"?   There's a chance your download -- or the way it extracted -- is corrupt, in which case it will be easiest to just copy the files off a USB drive in office hours. But I want to try a couple of other thing first.
from: Celina Hipolito
comment: 
from: Sean Munson
comment: Yeah... that looks like the file or extraction got corrupted (it should be about 10 GB). You can try re downloading, but it may not be worth the trouble. If you can make the Monday office hours, that may be a better use of your time.
from: Brent Gruenke
comment: I ran into the same issue. Windows 7. I finally just reinstalled everything then took the files from Dropbox and it works perfect now. I think the issue was something didn't extract right. Might be worth a try with the Dropbox files.
from: Celina Hipolito
comment: Okay, I'll try that! Thanks guys!!
from: Kate Cowley
post: Does anybody know how I would go about doing HW0 Part 7 (Downloading code snippets) while not on the VM?   I was able to clone the repository per the setup instructions using git bash. That also got me the code file for lecture 2, but I'm guessing I shouldn't have to clone every time I want to update.  I tried looking it up online, but I'm hoping somebody can confirm because this is all new to me. Is updating as simple as navigating to my master directory and then doing 'git pull' ?
from: Samuel San Nicolas
comment: The file is on the canvas page. Download that and just run it. It's just a bash script that pretty much just fetches from the git repo, so I don't think you really need it though.
from: Sean Munson
comment: Hi Kate - it will mostly be as simple as a git pull, depending on where you edit your homeworks
from: Josephine Le
comment: I did setup without VM on a MacBook -- not sure what computer you're using, but this is what worked for me:   I downloaded the ./getHW.sh file from Canvas and put it in the hcde310a16 folder (from cloning the repository). Navigate there in Terminal, then type ./getHW.sh and it should update whenever you type that in the future. If permission is denied (which it was for me the first time I tried) then type: chmod 0755 ./getHW.sh
from: Kate Cowley
comment: Got it working, thank you all!
from: Melody Lee
post: Is anybody else having trouble with Virtual Machine and their internet connection? My internet was working fine until I tried to use the Internet through the Virtual Machine, just spend an hour talking to the Internet guy - it shows as my connection being fine but nothing on Internet will load. Closed out of VM, restarted multiple times, etc. All other devices work fine on the Internet... anybody know of a solution?
from: Sean Munson
comment: Does your Internet connection work fine other than in the Virtual Machine?   If so, it's probably the case that Virtual Machine need to be configured a little differently on your system. In VirtualBox, select Devices -> Network from the menu, and then Network settings. You should have a drop down, options that *usually* work for are: NAT NAT Network NAT Bridged   one student last year found that NAT didn't work at first, changed it to something else, and that didn't work -- and then changed it back to NAT, only to have it start working.  So maybe try those three, and then go back to whatever it whatever it was on if it doesn't start working. If that doesn't work, let us know what operating system you are on and we can do some more reading  to see if that prompts any more ideas.
from: Pooja Ghelani
post: I keep getting locked out of virtual box, and none of the passwords / my uw password doesn't work. I'm not sure why?
from: ShinYoung Lucia Choi
comment: Try hcde310a16 that's the password for the VM if I remember correctly.
from: Pooja Ghelani
comment: Thanks! Also for part 7 I'm not really sure what we're supposed to take a screenshot of. This is what happens in the terminal  when I type this: ./getHW.sh. in
from: Jessie Kuo
comment: If I'm not wrong, after you downloaded the latest work from git repository (which you did in this case) you should take a screenshot of Eclipse (the left side where the project listings are) showing that you have "s2" in your "Lectures" file. Hope this helps ~
from: Sean Munson
comment: Yup - if s2 appears, we know it's working. You may need to right click the Lectures folder and select "Refresh"
from: Mackenna Lees
post: Anyone with Windows having major problems extracting the Mint file? E.g. "Virtual Box cannot open this session"
from: Kelsey Fukuda
comment: I had this problem a lot! Even downloading VM directly didn't work. I got the uncompressed file from one of the instructors' flash drives instead
from: Sean Munson
comment: Hi Mackenna - if it doesn't work, you might also try downloading one the Dropbox zip file (https://www.dropbox.com/s/0aawafxoik35v5a/VM310.zip?dl=0) or the tar.gz (https://www.dropbox.com/s/nsry38imz2uaowr/VM310.tar.gz?dl=0). These were each compressed a different way, so they *may* work better.  If not, we can work with you in office hours on Monday (12-1:00pm or 3:30pm) to get things set up. Or those times don't work, I can leave a USB drive with the HCDE front office by mid-morning Monday.

post: Any input on whether having Python on the virtual machine vs an IDE is more of the "industry standard?"
from: Samuel San Nicolas
comment: What do you mean by "on"? In my experience, most people write their code in an IDE and then test/deploy through some command line interface. Usually it's up to personal preference though. Although I'd say learning to use the command line is pretty important.
from: Sean Munson
comment: Yeah -- similar to Samuel's experiences, once you start developing production apps, people tend to develop in whatever environment is comfortable for them (or specified by their employer) and then test/run it elsewhere.  Later in the quarter, we'll get to Google Cloud SDK (formerly App Engine), which uses virtual machines to run production environments. Amazon Web Services Elastic Compute Cloud follows a similar approach. This is a common approach, for a mix of reasons. The top in my experience are: (1) you can customize the virtual system to your application's, (2) you can limit the amount of resources your virtual system uses on a shared physical machine,  (3) if you (or someone else using the same physical machine) writes a buggy app that crashes the system, it (typically) crashes just the virtual machine, rather than the entire system, and (4) it's easy to launch other "instances" of the virtual machine on other systems, so you can handle sudden spikes in traffic.   Approaches like that are common for web apps now.  But I've also had some projects (typically remote collaborations) where it was easiest to create a virtual machine and run it on our own laptops, just like in class. For small scale data analysis, you also often write and run the code on the same system -- we do this a lot in our research, and many people do that for weblog analysis on small or medium sites (but this quickly becomes impractical when you get to Facebook-scale data).  Docker (https://www.docker.com/what-docker) has also become increasingly popular, and we're using it for some projects in our research now. A big difference is that VirtualMachines require you to run an entire guest operating system (in 310, this is the Linux Mint distribution), which has a lot of overhead in spaced resources. Docker relies on the host operating system (Windows, OS X, or whatever else you are already running) but still sets up containers with customized environments and resource environments. It's also increasingly supported by cloud hosting services (e.g., Google Cloud).

post: Is eclipse an application in the menu bar or a folder on the home screen? So far it's just a folder for me that does not contain the 'homeworks' project nor hw0 folder. Does eclipse have to be downloaded as well? Or how has everyone else been accessing eclipse?
from: Oorja Chowdhary
comment: It should be on the desktop of the VM, so you shouldn't have to download it.
from: Madison Holbrook
comment: That's what I thought. Have you been able to access it and manipulate the homework file?
from: Oorja Chowdhary
comment: Yeah! It should be on the left side of Eclipse under a folder called Homeworks.
from: Madison Holbrook
comment: Alright I'll try again! Thanks
from: Sean Munson
comment: Let us know if that doesn't work - if you can post a screenshot of what you do see, that should help us figure out the next steps for troubleshooting
from: Madison Holbrook
comment: I figured it out! Thanks. I was in the wrong screen, so I only saw a file for eclipse and not the actual application.
from: Karena Vongampai
post: If we're uploading our code file through the virtual machine, is it alright to do 2 submissions? 1 containing the code file, and the other a document with all the screenshots in it?
from: Sean Munson
comment: If you do two submissions, please leave a submission comment - the tool we have for downloading assignments usually only downloads the latest submission.  It *may* also be possible to drag and drop the file from the virtual machine to your computer - though that does not work on every system. On a Mac, you might have to enable it by going to the Devices menu, then enabling guest to host or bidirectional drag and drop.

post: Once I have Linux running in the virtual machine what is the next step?. Should it have python on it?
from: Oorja Chowdhary
comment: Yeah it should have python 2.7 on there, and you would run the python programs using Eclipse! Most of the instructions are on the hw0 pdf.
