post: Hey guys! I left my computer charger (apple mac) in siege student lounge around 3:30 during office hours. Did anyone happen to see it or pick it up?
from: Maria Medina
comment: Msged you!!
from: Sheena White
post: I'm not sure what happened because I was able to commit/push earlier into my respository, but now it's not working. I was working on hw2 Part 2 and I'm getting errors when I try to commit. I deleted the hw2 files and added them again, and then had to change the hw2-exercises.py file to hw2exercises.py because it said it was invalid. Here's what happens in terminal: I appreciate any help!
from: Sean Munson
comment: Hi Sheena - to help debug, did you add hw2/* to git before or after changing file names and deleting them?
from: Sheena White
comment: I did it before and after I changed the names... when I exited out of everything after deleting all hw2 files, then started VirtualBox again, I went to add hw2 files using "./gethW.sh 2" and when I open hw2-execises.py it says "Invalid name for Python module: hw2-exercises (it'll not be analyzed)"
from: Sheena White
comment: this time I didn't change the name, didn't work on the hw2-exercises.py file and just tried to commit but it gives me the same message
from: Sean Munson
comment: My guess is that git got confused by losing track of the deleted files.   If you haven't finished hw2, it's probably best to work through that first, since you can finish that and upload a copy to Canvas without git working.  For troubleshooting, the first thing I'd try is to try a commit that notices removed files: git commit -a -m "hw2: Part 2 complete"
from: Sean Munson
comment: That may still, though, give you an error, in which case it may be easier to debug in office hours or class.
from: Sheena White
comment: Ok, I've already finished with the hw2-exercises.py so I'll try and figure that out... but I'm stuck now on part3: I keep getting 18 characters for test.txt instead of 22 like it says, but I still count 18 characters??
from: Sheena White
comment: with using end of line characters, I still only get 20, am I missing something?  This is splitting only whitespace: ['This\n'] ['is', 'our\n'] ['test', 'file.'] 20 characters
from: Sean Munson
comment: Spaces are also characters - remember that split() removes the white space it splits on.
from: Sheena White
comment: Ok, thanks!

post: This may be a silly question but how/what do I turn in for HW2?

post: It was working completely fine until I was working on number 4 of HW 2 part 2. I erased the code of that part and tried to run it again, but it wouldn't run anymore. Could anyone please explain why I'm getting this error message? Why does it say "no module named hw1. hw1" on the console? This was not showing up before I started number 4. Thanks!
from: Jessie Kuo
comment: I had that same problem last Thursday and professor Sean told me that happens to eclipse sometimes. All you have to do is comment it out with "#"
from: Michael Fern
comment: Jessie Kuo has the gist of it,  This is happening because eclipse is auto completing the import statement "from h1.hw1 import lst", this happens when you press tab or sometimes even automatically fills in itself. This line will is not necessary for the assignment and can be deleted completely, although commenting would work too

comment: is there a good way to make sure the .py files I am submitting is the committed and changed version of the homework?
from: Sean Munson
comment: I'm not sure what shows up in the view you get on Canvas, but at least in our grading view, Canvas shows the python file as plain text.  The most common mistake in past years has been uploading from Homeworks_OriginalVersion, so double check that (a) you've saved the Python file in Eclipse or your other editor and (b) that you're uploading from the right folder.  Also, if you continue committing and pushing to Bitbucket (please do!), you can check on the web that you've successfully sent your code to the repository. On the web, you can go to your repository, git, source, and then the homework file. This also gives you a timestamped backup, just in case anything goes wrong with the Canvas submission.

I think you can do (each command is a separate line):  cd ~/CourseFiles/hcde310a16 git init git remote add origin https://git.assembla.com/hcde310a16.git  then try:  cd ~ ./getHW.sh  my *guess* is you will get an error in there somewhere, so when you do, go ahead and post that and we can debug from there
from: Addison Simon
comment: 
from: Sean Munson
comment: thanks. This looks like progress. Let's try:  cd ~/CourseFiles/hcde310a16/ git pull origin master  if that works, then we can change back to the home directory and try to get HW2  cd ~ ./getHW.sh 2
from: Eric Eckert
post: Hello,  The getHW.sh has a small issues that I would like to highlight. After some testing I discovered that if the files/folders in ./CourseFiles/hcde310a16/Homeworks are altered or moved, and getHW.sh is run again, the git fetch only seems to check whether the correct subdirectories exist and not the files. And if getHW.sh is run with a number parameter, it's written to simply copy the .py files from ./CourseFiles/hcde310a16/Homeworks to ./Homeworks. The result is that when the latter is called, the former files do not exist and the homework cannot be fetched. But if getHw.sh is called again, it does not replace the .py files because the subdirectories do exist.  I tried a few different options and discovered that git fetch followed by git reset --hard solves the problem on my computer because it always overrides everything in ./CourseFiles/hcde310a16. That shouldn't be a problem because the user is asked if they want to override the Homework files when copying them over anyways. The git reset --hard seems to not work on the Linux mint vm. Maybe one of the TAs can do some testing with this?
from: Sean Munson
comment: Thanks Eric. I've looked through, and a couple of notes:  =Virtual Machine = This seems to be working as expected. The git pull is outside the conditional and will run regardless of whether an argument is provided.  It does have the issue that if you delete a hw directory within CourseFiles/Homeworks, it won't reappear -- this is git performing as expected. This should be okay since the CourseFiles directory is meant to mostly be left alone with homeworks instead being done in ~/Homeworks.   I was able to run git reset --hard within the hcde310a16 directory (note: not encouraging this in general, since it'll overwrite any changes you have made to lecture files).  = getHW.sh on Canvas (for macOS) =  I've looked here too -- the git pull is outside the the conditionals, so the git fetch should be running regardless of whether it is run with our without the number.  So it seems like the only issue that occurs is when files or directories are moved from within ./CourseFIles/hcde310a16/Homeworks?  It's also possible I'm misunderstanding, so please let me know if so.
from: Eric Eckert
comment: Sean  Thanks for the quick reply! I do think we're on the same page. I didn't know that its not supposed to replace the files so I suppose nothing is wrong there. Yes in theory there shouldn't be any missing homework directories but I've encountered some cases where some of them are in fact missing, and the student was not able to pull homeworks as a result. I am just wondering if that base could be covered in case it happens again.
from: Sean Munson
comment: Got it, thanks - I'll give it some thought and test some things; also adding Michael to the thread to think about it. I've tried to pick the right set of tradeoffs between which mistakes are possible vs. prevented with this script, but knowing which issues come up can help us rethink it.
from: Eric Eckert
comment: Thank you Sean!
from: Michael Fern
comment: My two cents, The way things are done can leave some confusion. With that said I have noticed that for some the distinction between the class repository that getHW pulls from(CourseFiles/hcde310a16) and the copy folders(i.e. Homeworks, Homeworks_OrginalVersions) allows for an initial understanding of a couple of the more core Git rules. Ideally, if the system is used correctly people shouldn't have to do too much else other than running getHW.* To do that however, sometimes some further explanation of Git is necessary.  Eric it seems like you are adding a bit of customization to your system, which is great! If you want to stop by office hours to show us what you've done we would be happy to take a look and perhaps change the class copy of getHW.* script to make the system as a whole more intuitive. If this interests you I have intended office hours are from 12-1pm and alternatively have free time before and after that :-)
from: Becky Baron
post: I'm using my own environment and eclipse insisted that I change the names of my files to use an underscore instead of a dash because otherwise the name was not "a valid identifier." For example, I'm now using the file name  "hw2_exercises.py" instead of "hw2-exercises.py". I'm not really sure what the issue is, but will it be a problem if i submit the files on canvas with the different names?
from: Sean Munson
comment: Hi Becky -- that should be okay. If it's easy to rename them when you upload, that might save the TAs a few seconds but overall not a major issue. (but John or Chia-Fang, please speak up if this will break your grading process!)
from: Michael Fern
from: Eric Eckert
comment: Thanks for the new script! I took a look at it and noticed it creates a "Homework" and "Homework Original Version" directory, but it pulls to "/CourseFiles/hcde310a16/Homeworks" leaving the former two directories empty. Were we supposed to use those directories for something?
from: Michael Fern
comment: Correct, if you run just the getHW.sh script those two folders will be created but left empty. To update 'Homeworks' and Homeworks_OringinalVersions' you have to designate which hw set to download. So.. $ sh getHW.sh 2 will  copy the files for the HW2 folder only
from: Eric Eckert
comment: Ok thanks. I realized I just made a small error in editing the bash script my bad.
from: Chia-Fang Chung
post: [HW2 & beyond] If you would like to submit a newer version of any part of the assignment, please resubmit all the files.  Canvas only allows us batch-download the latest submission. If you can help make sure that latest submission contains all your files, it'll make sure we don't miss your files and make our life a lot easier! Thanks :)

from: Sean Munson
comment: What directory are you in?  To run getHW.sh on the virtual machine, you'll need to be in your home directory. In your virtual machine, you can tell you are in the home directory because the prompt will be hcde310@adminuser-VirtualBox ~ $ rather than another directory, e.g. hcde310@adminuser-VirtualBox ~/Homeworks $

comment: Are you on a Mac or Windows?  If on a Mac, does getHW.sh show up if you list the directory contents (to do this, you can type "ls" at the terminal).  On Windows, we've been using getHW.bat, and to see if that's in the current directory, you can type "dir" in powershell.
from: Mackenna Lees
comment: mmk. I'm in hcde310a16, then homeworks and after using getHW.bat the system says that is not recognized as an internal or external command. Not sure what else I should try.
from: Sean Munson
comment: This might be more easily addressed in a few seconds in class (since you're on your own system, it's hard for us know exactly where everything is or to know the state), so maybe catch one of us at the start of class?

from: Lauren Beehler
post: Is it ok if we send you the link to our GitHub/ BitBucket repo instead of uploading the .py file?
from: Sean Munson
comment: Hi Lauren. Thanks for asking -- on this one: 1) we'd prefer that you make the repo private.  2) Canvas makes it really easy for us to download all the assignments at once, which gets a bit harder when code is distributed across 90 repositories. It would help the TAs give everyone timely feedback if you can upload the file.

post: I am trying to commit my HW 1 but when I go to commit, I get an error message saying "There are no staged files." I successfully committed everything else before so I'm confused now.
from: Sean Munson
comment: Hi Kelly -- for some reason, the latest version of Eclipse doesn't seem to always recognize that you've changed a file and that it should be staged.   After you click "commit", you'll see a dialog box / panel for your commit. To the left, there should be a box "unstaged files" -- right click on the file you've changed and click "add to index"  This should work. It's also annoying, and so it may be easier to commit from terminal. I'll post notes on that shortly.

post: I have completed HW1 and I did team->commit->team-> push to upstream, entered my password, and everything was working fine. Accept now, on my bitbucket page it is not showing that anything has been committed since I did my first one last night. I have done the entire process both on the larger homework file and HW1, but neither has shown anything on the bitbucket website that it was backed up correctly. Any thoughts? I just want to make sure everything is saved before I submit and exit out.

comment: When you do team->commit, do you get any error messages? Anything about unstaged changes?
from: Emma Faubion
comment: I was having the same issue. The last window that pops up before it seems like it's all good, does it have a message in brackets? Like not available or something.
from: Sean Munson
comment: When you are committing, are you using commit and push, or just commit?   Assuming everything is good there and it's still not working, you can also try to just use git at the terminal: https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1066100/pages/git-from-terminal
from: Kelly Xu
post: Does anyone know if there is a specific command aside from cd that I have to use to access a folder in terminal? I know the folder exists because when I use the command ls, the folder is listed to be there but when I try to cd to it, it tells me the file doesn't exist.
from: Sean Munson
comment: Hi Kelly -- it's usually "cd <directory name>".  e.g., "cd Homeworks" will move you from your home folder to the Homeworks folder. One common, easy error here is that directory names are case sensitive.   If that doesn't do the trick, let us know which folder, and/or post a screenshot and I or others may have more ideas!

from: Sean Munson
comment: A couple of students had this issue in class on Thursday -- the issue seemed to be having two copies of VirtualBox open at the same time (which can be hard to see in Windows, because of how it aggregates different instances in the task bar). Any chance you have more than one instance of VirtualBox open?

from: Jackie Yu
comment: Same problem here. I've deleted all the extra files, but this is still popping up
from: Alex Gilbert
comment: hey all, I've done some testing and found a solution for you. it is a bit of a hassle, so if needed I can look at it in class. for those who want to try it now (I've only tested on windows!), here it is:  1) Open up your command prompt (by typing cmd in the start menu and clicking on it). Navigate to where you installed virtual box - if you didn't move it around, you can type  cd C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox\  into your cmd.  2) Now, you'll have to copy and paste   VBOXMANAGE.EXE internalcommands sethduuid "DIRECTORY"  into your cmd, except replace DIRECTORY with the HCDE310 .vdi file location. Make sure you keep the quotes! for example, my file is located at C:\Users\Alex\Downloads\mint2\HCDE310-linuxmint-17.1-cinnamon-64bit.vdi, so I would type   VBOXMANAGE.EXE internalcommands sethduuid "C:\Users\Alex\Downloads\mint2\HCDE310-linuxmint-17.1-cinnamon-64bit.vdi"  This changes the UUID - you're getting this error because you've moved the location of the VM and are using the same image. virtual box is funny that way.  This is slightly complex, so feel free to ask for clarification! Otherwise, I can help you in/after class tomorrow.

comment: Hi Bonnie -- what's triggering this dialog box? There shoudn't be anything in the homework that requires authenticating with Assembla (it's set to read only public access).
from: Josephine Le
comment: I thought it was just the link to use when you "git clone <git repository URL>". I didn't use VM so this is the route I took to clone the hcde310a16 repository. You don't need user/pw when cloning
from: Sean Munson
comment: Ah, okay. This seems to want to open it in the web browser, which Assembla doesn't like. You can view the repository directly in a web browser with out being logged in at: https://app.assembla.com/spaces/hcde310a16/git/source  and the scripts *should* work fine if you run the getHW.* scripts (whichever is appropriate for your environment). It's just clicking the .git link that seems to ask for authentication.

from: Sean Munson
comment: Hi Becky - I *think* that what's happening is the virtual machine doesn't recognize it should be scaling up the display content for your high res display.

comment: On most systems, you can drag the files to the desktop on your main computer. You might have to enable this under the "Devices" menu -> Drag and Drop -> Guest to Host (or bidirectional)
from: Addison Simon
comment: I did that, and now it seems to allow the picture to be dragged and dropped onto my desktop, except within virtual machine I get a "dropping data..." notification that remains at 0% so the picture is never fully copied onto the desktop.
from: Sean Munson
comment: Hrm. This may mean it doesn't work so well on your system. Are you on Windows or macOS?   I'm on macOS, and sometimes for expedience I just take the screenshot using macOS's utilities (cmd+shift+4, and then drag around the area I want -- the trick is I have to be *outside* the virtual box to take a screenshot).

comment: Hi Celina -- a couple of questions to help troubleshoot. (1) Did you install from the download or a USB drive? (2) did it ever run correctly on your machine?
from: Celina Hipolito
comment: I downloaded from google drive and no, it gives me this error every time.

comment: If, in the VirtualBox Manager window, you click on settings, can you post a screenshot of the results?

comment: thanks -- can you try running "check"?   There's a chance your download -- or the way it extracted -- is corrupt, in which case it will be easiest to just copy the files off a USB drive in office hours. But I want to try a couple of other thing first.

comment: Yeah... that looks like the file or extraction got corrupted (it should be about 10 GB). You can try re downloading, but it may not be worth the trouble. If you can make the Monday office hours, that may be a better use of your time.

comment: I ran into the same issue. Windows 7. I finally just reinstalled everything then took the files from Dropbox and it works perfect now. I think the issue was something didn't extract right. Might be worth a try with the Dropbox files.
from: Celina Hipolito
comment: Okay, I'll try that! Thanks guys!!

post: Does anybody know how I would go about doing HW0 Part 7 (Downloading code snippets) while not on the VM?   I was able to clone the repository per the setup instructions using git bash. That also got me the code file for lecture 2, but I'm guessing I shouldn't have to clone every time I want to update.  I tried looking it up online, but I'm hoping somebody can confirm because this is all new to me. Is updating as simple as navigating to my master directory and then doing 'git pull' ?
from: Samuel San Nicolas
comment: The file is on the canvas page. Download that and just run it. It's just a bash script that pretty much just fetches from the git repo, so I don't think you really need it though.
from: Sean Munson
comment: Hi Kate - it will mostly be as simple as a git pull, depending on where you edit your homeworks
from: Josephine Le
comment: I did setup without VM on a MacBook -- not sure what computer you're using, but this is what worked for me:   I downloaded the ./getHW.sh file from Canvas and put it in the hcde310a16 folder (from cloning the repository). Navigate there in Terminal, then type ./getHW.sh and it should update whenever you type that in the future. If permission is denied (which it was for me the first time I tried) then type: chmod 0755 ./getHW.sh

comment: Got it working, thank you all!
from: Pooja Ghelani
post: I keep getting locked out of virtual box, and none of the passwords / my uw password doesn't work. I'm not sure why?
from: ShinYoung Lucia Choi
comment: Try hcde310a16 that's the password for the VM if I remember correctly.
from: Pooja Ghelani
comment: Thanks! Also for part 7 I'm not really sure what we're supposed to take a screenshot of. This is what happens in the terminal  when I type this: ./getHW.sh. in
from: Jessie Kuo
comment: If I'm not wrong, after you downloaded the latest work from git repository (which you did in this case) you should take a screenshot of Eclipse (the left side where the project listings are) showing that you have "s2" in your "Lectures" file. Hope this helps ~
from: Sean Munson
comment: Yup - if s2 appears, we know it's working. You may need to right click the Lectures folder and select "Refresh"

post: Anyone with Windows having major problems extracting the Mint file? E.g. "Virtual Box cannot open this session"
from: Kelsey Fukuda
comment: I had this problem a lot! Even downloading VM directly didn't work. I got the uncompressed file from one of the instructors' flash drives instead
from: Sean Munson
comment: Hi Mackenna - if it doesn't work, you might also try downloading one the Dropbox zip file (https://www.dropbox.com/s/0aawafxoik35v5a/VM310.zip?dl=0) or the tar.gz (https://www.dropbox.com/s/nsry38imz2uaowr/VM310.tar.gz?dl=0). These were each compressed a different way, so they *may* work better.  If not, we can work with you in office hours on Monday (12-1:00pm or 3:30pm) to get things set up. Or those times don't work, I can leave a USB drive with the HCDE front office by mid-morning Monday.

post: Any input on whether having Python on the virtual machine vs an IDE is more of the "industry standard?"
from: Samuel San Nicolas
comment: What do you mean by "on"? In my experience, most people write their code in an IDE and then test/deploy through some command line interface. Usually it's up to personal preference though. Although I'd say learning to use the command line is pretty important.
from: Sean Munson
comment: Yeah -- similar to Samuel's experiences, once you start developing production apps, people tend to develop in whatever environment is comfortable for them (or specified by their employer) and then test/run it elsewhere.  Later in the quarter, we'll get to Google Cloud SDK (formerly App Engine), which uses virtual machines to run production environments. Amazon Web Services Elastic Compute Cloud follows a similar approach. This is a common approach, for a mix of reasons. The top in my experience are: (1) you can customize the virtual system to your application's, (2) you can limit the amount of resources your virtual system uses on a shared physical machine,  (3) if you (or someone else using the same physical machine) writes a buggy app that crashes the system, it (typically) crashes just the virtual machine, rather than the entire system, and (4) it's easy to launch other "instances" of the virtual machine on other systems, so you can handle sudden spikes in traffic.   Approaches like that are common for web apps now.  But I've also had some projects (typically remote collaborations) where it was easiest to create a virtual machine and run it on our own laptops, just like in class. For small scale data analysis, you also often write and run the code on the same system -- we do this a lot in our research, and many people do that for weblog analysis on small or medium sites (but this quickly becomes impractical when you get to Facebook-scale data).  Docker (https://www.docker.com/what-docker) has also become increasingly popular, and we're using it for some projects in our research now. A big difference is that VirtualMachines require you to run an entire guest operating system (in 310, this is the Linux Mint distribution), which has a lot of overhead in spaced resources. Docker relies on the host operating system (Windows, OS X, or whatever else you are already running) but still sets up containers with customized environments and resource environments. It's also increasingly supported by cloud hosting services (e.g., Google Cloud).

comment: I see. That makes a lot of sense - thanks for the help!

post: Is eclipse an application in the menu bar or a folder on the home screen? So far it's just a folder for me that does not contain the 'homeworks' project nor hw0 folder. Does eclipse have to be downloaded as well? Or how has everyone else been accessing eclipse?
from: Oorja Chowdhary
comment: It should be on the desktop of the VM, so you shouldn't have to download it.
from: Madison Holbrook
comment: That's what I thought. Have you been able to access it and manipulate the homework file?
from: Oorja Chowdhary
comment: Yeah! It should be on the left side of Eclipse under a folder called Homeworks.
from: Madison Holbrook
comment: Alright I'll try again! Thanks
from: Sean Munson
comment: Let us know if that doesn't work - if you can post a screenshot of what you do see, that should help us figure out the next steps for troubleshooting
from: Madison Holbrook
comment: I figured it out! Thanks. I was in the wrong screen, so I only saw a file for eclipse and not the actual application.

post: If we're uploading our code file through the virtual machine, is it alright to do 2 submissions? 1 containing the code file, and the other a document with all the screenshots in it?
from: Sean Munson
comment: If you do two submissions, please leave a submission comment - the tool we have for downloading assignments usually only downloads the latest submission.  It *may* also be possible to drag and drop the file from the virtual machine to your computer - though that does not work on every system. On a Mac, you might have to enable it by going to the Devices menu, then enabling guest to host or bidirectional drag and drop.

post: Once I have Linux running in the virtual machine what is the next step?. Should it have python on it?
from: Oorja Chowdhary
comment: Yeah it should have python 2.7 on there, and you would run the python programs using Eclipse! Most of the instructions are on the hw0 pdf.
