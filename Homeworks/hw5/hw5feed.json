So our line would look something like:\n\"word\",postcount,commentcount\n\nThat, however, causes a new problem -- since the same lines have quotes in them as well. You can escape quotes in CSV files by using another quote before it. So if we had a word: someFunc(\"some string\"), we could escape those by using two quotes: someFunc(\"\"somestring\"\")\n\nor, to put it all together, the line, if opened in a text editor, would look like:\n\"someFunc(\"\"somestring\"\")\",0,1 \n\nThe code for replacing double quotes with double double quotes is: \nword.replace(\"\\\"\",\"\\\"\\\"\")",

After some testing I discovered that if the files\/folders in .\/CourseFiles\/hcde310a16\/Homeworks are altered or moved, and getHW.sh is run again, the git fetch only seems to check whether the correct subdirectories exist and not the files. And if getHW.sh is run with a number parameter, it's written to simply copy the .py files from .\/CourseFiles\/hcde310a16\/Homeworks to .\/Homeworks. The result is that when the latter is called, the former files do not exist and the homework cannot be fetched. But if getHw.sh is called again, it does not replace the .py files because the subdirectories do exist.\n\nI tried a few different options and discovered that git fetch followed by git reset --hard solves the problem on my computer because it always overrides everything in .\/CourseFiles\/hcde310a16. That shouldn't be a problem because the user is asked if they want to override the Homework files when copying them over anyways. The git reset --hard seems to not work on the Linux mint vm. Maybe one of the TAs can do some testing with this?",

Ideally, if the system is used correctly people shouldn\u2019t have to do too much else other than running \u2018getHW.*\u2019 To do that however, sometimes some further explanation of Git is necessary.\n\nEric it seems like you are adding a bit of customization to your system, which is great!

Navigate to where you installed virtual box - if you didn't move it around, you can type\n\ncd C:\\Program Files\\Oracle\\VirtualBox\\\n\ninto your cmd.\n\n2) Now, you'll have to copy and paste \n\nVBOXMANAGE.EXE internalcommands sethduuid \"DIRECTORY\"\n\ninto your cmd, except replace DIRECTORY with the HCDE310 .vdi file location. Make sure you keep the quotes! for example, my file is located at C:\\Users\\Alex\\Downloads\\mint2\\HCDE310-linuxmint-17.1-cinnamon-64bit.vdi, so I would type \n\nVBOXMANAGE.EXE internalcommands sethduuid \"C:\\Users\\Alex\\Downloads\\mint2\\HCDE310-linuxmint-17.1-cinnamon-64bit.vdi\"\n\nThis changes the UUID - you're getting this error because you've moved the location of the VM and are using the same image. virtual box is funny that way.\n\nThis is slightly complex, so feel free to ask for clarification!

				"message": "Yeah -- similar to Samuel's experiences, once you start developing production apps, people tend to develop in whatever environment is comfortable for them (or specified by their employer) and then test\/run it elsewhere.\n\nLater in the quarter, we'll get to Google Cloud SDK (formerly App Engine), which uses virtual machines to run production environments. Amazon Web Services Elastic Compute Cloud follows a similar approach. This is a common approach, for a mix of reasons. The top in my experience are: (1) you can customize the virtual system to your application's, (2) you can limit the amount of resources your virtual system uses on a shared physical machine,  (3) if you (or someone else using the same physical machine) writes a buggy app that crashes the system, it (typically) crashes just the virtual machine, rather than the entire system, and (4) it's easy to launch other \"instances\" of the virtual machine on other systems, so you can handle sudden spikes in traffic. \n\nApproaches like that are common for web apps now.  But I've also had some projects (typically remote collaborations) where it was easiest to create a virtual machine and run it on our own laptops, just like in class. For small scale data analysis, you also often write and run the code on the same system -- we do this a lot in our research, and many people do that for weblog analysis on small or medium sites (but this quickly becomes impractical when you get to Facebook-scale data).\n\nDocker (https:\/\/www.docker.com\/what-docker) has also become increasingly popular, and we're using it for some projects in our research now. A big difference is that VirtualMachines require you to run an entire guest operating system (in 310, this is the Linux Mint distribution), which has a lot of overhead in spaced resources. Docker relies on the host operating system (Windows, OS X, or whatever else you are already running) but still sets up containers with customized environments and resource environments. It's also increasingly supported by cloud hosting services (e.g., Google Cloud).",
