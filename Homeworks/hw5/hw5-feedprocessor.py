#    def __str__(self):
#         fill in code here. (3.a)
#         the string being returned should be similiar to that of Post.__str__()
#         except it should also print out the linked picture's preview URL
#         and link URL (see PDF for details)


### Main block
if __name__ == '__main__':  
    # this loads the facebook group data as a list of dictionaries
    postdicts = json.load(open('hw5feed.json'))['data']

    print "-- TEST 1 --"
    ### Test 1: polymorphism with  __str__() methods
    # sample Posts to print
    # this post is short (< 140 chars)
    my_post_short = Post(postdicts[72])
    # this post is long (> 140 chars)
    my_post_long = Post(postdicts[61])

    print "- elements -"

    print "- short post -"
#    print my_post_short
    print "- long post -"

    # testing building block 2
#    mypic = Picture(postdicts[1])
#    print mypic                     # tests (3a)

    for postdict in postdicts:
        # make a Post, Picture, or Link object from the post dictionary depending
        # on the value of the "type" key in the post dictionary

        # add the post object to the list
        postobjects.append(postobject)

    ### Test 2: Outputting Picture objects as a web page: (testing 3a,b)
#    uncomment the following line of code and verify that hcde310pictures.html
#    displays thumbnail images that link back to the respective facebook picture
#    include hcde310pictures.html in your Canvas upload

#    genPicturePage(postobjects, 'hcde310pictures.html')


    ### Task 1: printing questions
    print ";;;;; Task: printing questions ;;;;;;;"
    first25 = postobjects[:25]  # sample set of posts
    # fill in code here that prints just the questions and number of
    # comments received in the first 25 items in postobjects
    # Print your output as (also see PDF):  
    #    Short name  received # replies to their question:
    #    short message
    # hint: use your .hasQuestion() method


    ### Task 2: counting and printing totals  (this is optional but strongly recommended for review)
    print ";;;;; Post, Comment, and Like counts per person ;;;;;;;"
    # Loop through postobjects and count the number of posts made by each person
    # and the number of comments and likes they *received*
    # You may either use a dictionary for this or create a new class for a person
    # If you create a dictionary (you are most familiar with these),  
    # it should be in the format {Name:  {'posts':n,'comments':y,'likes':z},
    #                             Name2: {'posts':n,'comments':y,'likes':z},
    #                            ... }
    
    
    # then, write code to loop through your posters and print their totals
    # in the format:
    # Name posted n times and received y comments and z likes.
