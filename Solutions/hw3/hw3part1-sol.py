### part 1: exercises
dinocount = {'triceratops': 2, 'tyrannosaurus rex': 1, 'dilophosaurus': 2, 'parasaurolophus': 4, 'gallimimus': 12}

print "== 1 =="
# 1: accessing values at a specified key in a dictionary.

# Write code to print the number of gallimimuses (gallimimi?) in the our dinosaur zoo (the value
# associated with key 'gallimimus' in the dictionary dinocount). Hint: this is just
# one simple line of code.

print dinocount['gallimimus']

print "== 2 =="
# 2: incrementing the value of a dictionary at a key.

# Write code to increment the number of triceratops in the store by one (nature
# always finds a way). In other words, add 1 to the existing value of dinocount at
# key 'triceratops').  Then, print out the number of triceratops in the zoo.

dinocount['triceratops'] += 1
print dinocount['triceratops']

print "== 3 =="
# 3: adding an entry to a dictionary. 

# Our HCDE 310 dinosaur zoo just got in a shipment of velociraptors.
# (What could go wrong?)
# 
# Write code to insert a new key, 'velociraptor' into the dictionary, with a value of 3.
# Verify that it worked by printing out the value associated with the key 'velociraptor'

dinocount['velociraptor'] = 3
print dinocount['velociraptor']

print "== 4 =="
# 4: concatenating strings and integers. 

# Write code that creates a string that says 'Parasaurolophus: X', where X is the
# number of parasaurolophus extracted from the dinocount dictionary.  Print the string.
# Hint: you will need to use the + string concatenation operator in conjunction
# with str() or another string formatting instruction.

print "Parasaurolophus: %d"%dinocount['parasaurolophus']

print "== 5 =="
# 5: iterating over keys in a dictionary.  

# Write code that prints each kind of dinosaur (key),
# one line at a time using a for loop.

for k in dinocount:
    print k
    
# Note: your order may differ from the order in the homework PDF!

print "== 6 =="
# 6: iterating over keys to access values in a dictionary. 

# Write code that prints each kind of dinosaur (key), followed by a colon and the
# number of that kind of dinosaur (e.g., parasaurolophus: 3), one line at a time using a for loop.

for k in dinocount:
    print "%s: %d"%(k,dinocount[k])

print "== 7 =="
# 7: testing membership in a dictionary.

# Write code to test whether 'velociraptor' is in the dinocount dictionary.  If the test
# yields true, print "velociraptor: <x>", where <x> is the current number of
# velociraptors in the zoo. 
# If the test yields false, it should print "Sorry, no velociraptor in the zoo. "
# Do the same thing for the key 'stegosaurus'.

ds = ['velociraptor','stegosaurus']
for d in ds:
    if d in dinocount:
        print "%s: %d"%(d,dinocount[d])
    else:
        print "Sorry, no %s in the zoo."%d


print "== 8 =="
# 8: default values

# We have a list of potential dinosaurs (in the list potentialdinosaurs)
# and we want to check whether the dinosaur exists within the zoo (dictionary).
# If it is, we want to print "dinosaur: #", where dinosaur is the 
# dinosaur name and # is the number. If the dinosaur is not in the zoo, it should
# print zero. 
# Hint: you can use default values here to make this take less code!

potentialdinosaurs = ['velociraptor','tyrannosaurus rex','brachiosaurus','archaeopteryx','gallimimus']

# put your code here
for d in potentialdinosaurs:
    print "%s: %d"%(d,dinocount.get(d,0))

print '=== 9 ==='
# 9: printing comma separated data from a dictionary.
# You may have worked with comma separated values before: they are basically 
# spreadsheets or tables represented as plain text files, with each row
# represented on a new line and each cell divided by a comma.
#
# Print out the keys and values of the dictionary stored in dinocount. The keys
# and values you print should be separated only by commas (there should be no
# spaces). Print each key,value pair on a different line. Your output should
# match the screenshot in the PDF document, although the order of the keys may
# differ.
#
# Hint: this is almost identical to exercise 6 
#
# put your code here

for k in dinocount:
    print "%s,%d"%(k,dinocount[k])

print '=== 10 ==='
# 10: saving a dictionary to a CSV file
# Write key and value pairs from dinocount out to a file named 'dinocise.csv'.
# (hint: the procedure is very close to that of (9), but you will need to make a small
# modification to the string you are writing out to the file, to add linebreaks)
#
# put your code here

f = open("dinocise.csv",'w')
for k in dinocount:
    f.write("%s, %d\n"%(k,dinocount[k]))
f.close()
